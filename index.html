              Shift is an app to link freelancers with hiring managers in an accessible way. Eliminating the middleman, referrals are directly available on all user profiles with an average star rating and comment section. These review systems are only available after a job has been accepted; allowing only those that have interacted to review one another. This creates a greater transparency for other users when assessing a candidate or an employer.

              Foodlet is a food waste prevention website. It is used as a means to share food that would otherwise be disposed of. We have created this food sharing app, using Google Maps API. On login, the user's current geolocation is established and markers display shared food in their local area. Users can then click on the item to see more details and request for collection, this request is then sent to the profile of the post user, they then accept or decline the user they wish to share their food with.
              <br/><br/>
              AngularJS was the framework used for this project, what I liked most about the framework is the Two-way data binding, as it diffuses the impact after every minor data change and does way with the need for further effort with data sync in view and model.

              Fruit Frenzy was my first project at General Assembly. The UI was developed by myself with inspiration taken from the game Candy Crush. Initially it was meant to be developed with the same gaming functionality as Candy Crush but as this was my first time utilising heavy javaScript, I decided to make it a reactions game instead. This allowed me to manage the scalability and focus on ensuring the fundamentals were executed correctly.

              Having acquired a Bachelor of Arts in Industrial Design, I felt proficient in my abilities to produce aesthetically pleasing and usable UI designs, however I didn’t find it challenged me on an intellectual level. I felt I would be better suited to work that required practical thinking. Having set up a freelance company whilst at uni as a means of income I was designing and developing static web pages with basic javascript, html and css. I found that the pragmatism and creativity within code challenged me in a way that I felt was fulfilling.
              <br/><br/>
              Having recently completed General Assembly WDI course, I feel I am ready to start my professional career as a junior web developer. My primary interest is to join an agency that is invested in trying to hone my skills as a developer whilst also working in a fun environment.
